## Context

Gemini uses backward infinite scrolling for long conversations. Only recent messages are in the DOM; older ones load from the server when the user scrolls upward. The current `GeminiExtractor.extractMessages()` reads only DOM-present elements, silently truncating long conversations.

Investigation confirmed Gemini uses **append-only lazy loading** (NOT true virtual scroll). Once messages load into the DOM, they persist. `scrollTo({ top: 0 })` triggers server-side backfill.

---

## Decision

**Scroll-to-top with DOM stabilization** inside `GeminiExtractor`.

- Detect partial load via `scrollTop > 0` on `#chat-history`
- Programmatically `scrollTo({ top: 0 })` repeatedly (1s interval)
- Count `.conversation-container` elements; 3 consecutive unchanged readings = done
- Timeout at 30s; extract available messages + warning
- Short conversations (`scrollTop === 0`): bypass entirely, zero overhead

Implementation is confined to `GeminiExtractor` (private methods). No changes to `BaseExtractor`, `IConversationExtractor`, or `buildConversationResult()`.

---

## Alternatives Rejected

| Alternative | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| **MutationObserver** | Harder to test in jsdom, still needs timeout, no clear benefit over 1s polling |
| **Incremental scrollBy()** | Unnecessary — single `scrollTo(0)` triggers full backfill |
| **Network interception (batchexecute API)** | Fragile auth tokens, API instability, excessive complexity |
| **User notification only** | Pushes work to user; auto-scroll is automatic with graceful fallback |
| **Modify buildConversationResult()** | Shared interface change for Gemini-specific concern; warning can be appended after return |

---

## Consequences

**Positive**: Long conversations fully extracted; zero overhead for short ones; graceful timeout with warning.

**Risks**: Scroll briefly visible to user; selector change degrades to pre-fix behavior (not a regression); 30s cap may not load extremely long conversations.
